          "output": "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of p in the equation 24 = 2p. Hmm, so the equation is 24 equals 2 times p. Alright, let me think about how to solve for p here. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an equation like this, you want to isolate the variable p on one side. So, right now, the equation is 24 equals 2p. To get p by itself, I need to do the opposite of multiplying by 2. The opposite of multiplication is division. So, I should divide both sides of the equation by 2. \n\nLet me write that down step by step. Starting with the original equation:\n\n24 = 2p\n\nIf I divide both sides by 2, that should cancel out the 2 on the right side, leaving p. So:\n\n24 / 2 = (2p) / 2\n\nSimplifying both sides, 24 divided by 2 is 12, and 2 divided by 2 is 1. So now the equation becomes:\n\n12 = p\n\nTherefore, p equals 12. Let me check the options given. Option C is p = 12, so that must be the correct answer. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug the value back into the original equation to verify. If p is 12, then 2 times 12 should equal 24. 2*12 is indeed 24, which matches the left side of the equation. So that checks out. \n\nI don't see any other possible answers here. The other options are 4, 8, and 24. If I tried p = 4, then 2*4 would be 8, which is not 24. If p = 8, 2*8 is 16, still not 24. And p = 24 would make 2*24 = 48, which is way too big. So definitely, p has to be 12. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that 24 divided by 2 is 12, so p must be 12. There's no other number that when multiplied by 2 gives 24. So yeah, I'm confident that the correct answer is C, p = 12.</think>\n\n\nThe correct answer is **C. p = 12**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\( 24 = 2p \\)\n2. To isolate \\( p \\), divide both sides by 2:  \n   \\( \\frac{24}{2} = \\frac{2p}{2} \\)\n3. Simplify:  \n   \\( 12 = p \\)\n4. Verify by substituting \\( p = 12 \\) back into the original equation:  \n   \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\), which is true.\n\nThus, the value of \\( p \\) is **12**.",

          "output": "<think>Okay, let's see. Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, and she drove the same number of miles each day. The question is asking how many miles she drove each day. The options are A. 5, B. 7, C. 8, D. 9. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many miles she drove each day. Since she drove the same number of miles every day, I can divide the total miles by the number of days. That should give me the daily mileage. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal miles = 40\nNumber of days = 5\nDaily miles = Total miles / Number of days\n\nSo, 40 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation. 5 goes into 40 how many times? Well, 5 times 8 is 40. So, 40 divided by 5 is 8. That would mean she drove 8 miles each day. Let me check the options. Option C is 8. So, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when problems say \"the same number of miles each day,\" it's easy to misread. But the problem does specify that she drove the same number each day, so dividing total by days is the right approach. 40 divided by 5 is indeed 8. So, yes, 8 miles per day. Option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 5 days, so each day she drove 8 miles. Over 5 days, that's 5 times 8, which is 40. That checks out. So, the answer must be C. 8.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret the problem. The key here is that the number of miles per day is constant. If it were variable, the problem would have mentioned different distances each day, but it doesn't. So, straightforward division. Yep, 8 is the right answer. Option C.</think>\n\n\nMs. Perez drove a total of 40 miles over 5 days, and she drove the same number of miles each day. To find the daily mileage, divide the total miles by the number of days:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Daily miles} = \\frac{\\text{Total miles}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \n5 days \u00d7 8 miles/day = 40 miles (matches the total given).\n\n**Answer:** C. 8",

          "output": "<think>Okay, so I need to find the quotient of -40 divided by -8. Hmm, let's see. Dividing two negative numbers... I remember that when you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive because a negative divided by a negative is a positive. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nFirst, let me recall the basic division rule. If you have a positive divided by a positive, you get a positive. If it's a negative divided by a positive, you get a negative. And if it's a positive divided by a negative, that's also a negative. So, when both are negative, it should be positive. That seems right.\n\nSo, -40 divided by -8. Let me think of this as how many times -8 goes into -40. Maybe I can use another method to check. Let's convert this division into a multiplication by the reciprocal. So, -40 divided by -8 is the same as -40 multiplied by 1/(-8). \n\nCalculating that, -40 times 1/(-8) would be (-40) * (-1/8). Multiplying two negatives gives a positive, so that's 40/8. Then, 40 divided by 8 is 5. So, the result is 5. Therefore, the answer should be D. 5.\n\nWait, let me verify again. If I divide -40 by -8, another way to think about it is how many -8s are in -40. Since -8 is a larger number than -40, it can't be divided into it an integer number of times. But when dealing with division of negatives, the quotient is positive. So, 5 times -8 is -40. Let me check that: 5 * -8 = -40. Yes, that's correct. So, the quotient is indeed 5. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 5. So, that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the options. The options are A. 1/5, B. -5, C. -1/5, D. 5. Yep, D is 5. So, I think that's right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use fractions. -40 divided by -8 is the same as (-40)/(-8). When you divide two negatives, the negatives cancel out, leaving a positive. So, 40/8. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 8: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5, 8 \u00f7 8 = 1. So, 5/1, which is 5. Yep, same result. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is D. 5. No other options make sense here. If I had thought of absolute values, the absolute value of -40 is 40, and the absolute value of -8 is 8. So, 40 divided by 8 is 5. Since both were negative, the result is positive 5. So, definitely D. \n\nJust to recap: when dividing two negative numbers, the result is positive. The absolute values are 40 and 8, which divide to 5. So, the answer is D. 5. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning here. All methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.</think>\n\n\nThe quotient of \u221240 \u00f7 (\u22128) can be determined by recognizing that dividing two negative numbers results in a positive value. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Absolute Values**: The absolute values of \u221240 and \u22128 are 40 and 8, respectively.\n2. **Division**: \\( \\frac{40}{8} = 5 \\).\n3. **Sign Consideration**: Since both numbers are negative, their quotient is positive.\n\nThus, the result is **5**.\n\n**Answer:** D. 5",

          "output": "<think>Okay, let's see. The problem is about a soccer team that has $90.00 to buy soccer balls. Each soccer ball costs $15.60, and we need to find the greatest number of soccer balls they can buy. The options are A through D, with numbers 4, 5, 6, 7. Hmm, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I think the key here is to divide the total amount of money they have by the cost of one soccer ball. That should give the number of soccer balls they can buy. Let me write that down. So, total money is $90.00, and each ball is $15.60. So, 90 divided by 15.60. Let me do that division.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the division is exact or if there's a remainder. Because if there's a remainder, they can't buy a partial soccer ball, so they have to round down to the nearest whole number. So, the greatest number would be the integer part of the division result.\n\nLet me calculate 90 divided by 15.60. Let's see, 15.60 times 5 is 78.00. Because 15 times 5 is 75, and 0.60 times 5 is 3.00, so 75 + 3 is 78. So, 5 soccer balls would cost $78.00. Then, the remaining money would be 90 - 78 = $12.00. But each soccer ball is $15.60, so with $12.00, they can't buy another one. So, 5 is possible. But maybe they can buy 6? Let's check.\n\n15.60 times 6 is 93.60. Wait, that's more than $90.00. So, 6 soccer balls would cost $93.60, which is over the budget. So, 6 is too expensive. Then, 5 is possible, but maybe there's a higher number. Wait, the options are up to 7. Let me check 7.\n\n15.60 times 7. Let's calculate that. 15 times 7 is 105, but that's the whole number part. Then, 0.60 times 7 is 4.20. So, 105 + 4.20 = 109.20. That's way over $90.00. So, 7 is way too much. So, 5 is possible, but maybe 6 is not. Wait, but 5 is an option. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me do 90 divided by 15.60 more carefully. Let's convert 15.60 into a fraction to make it easier. 15.60 is the same as 156/10, which simplifies to 78/5. So, 90 divided by 78/5 is the same as 90 multiplied by 5/78. Let's compute that.\n\n90 multiplied by 5 is 450. Then, 450 divided by 78. Let's see, 78 times 5 is 390, 78 times 6 is 468. So, 450 is between 5 and 6. So, 450 divided by 78 is approximately 5.7692. So, approximately 5.77. So, that means they can buy 5 soccer balls, and there's some money left over. So, 5 is the answer. But let me check the options again. The options are A.4, B.5, C.6, D.7. So, 5 is an option. So, B is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me verify once more. If they buy 5 soccer balls, that's 5 times $15.60. Let's compute 5 times 15.60. 15 times 5 is 75, 0.60 times 5 is 3.00, so total is 75 + 3 = $78.00. Then, 90 - 78 = $12.00 left. So, they can't buy another one. So, 5 is the maximum. So, the answer is B.5.\n\nBut wait, the options include 6. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me check 6 times 15.60. 15.60 times 6. Let's do 15.60 * 6. 15 * 6 = 90, 0.60 * 6 = 3.60. So, 90 + 3.60 = 93.60. That's $93.60, which is more than $90.00. So, they can't afford 6. So, 6 is not possible. Then, 7 is even more. So,",

          "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that you and three friends go to a concert, and the total cost for four tickets is $112. We need to find the cost of one ticket, t. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. There are four people going to the concert, each buying one ticket. The total cost for all four tickets is $112. So, if I can set up an equation where the total cost is equal to the number of tickets multiplied by the cost per ticket, that should work.\n\nLet me write that out. The total cost is 4 tickets times the cost per ticket, t. So, 4t = 112. That seems straightforward. Then, to find the cost of one ticket, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 4. So, t = 112 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 112 divided by 4 is 28. So, the cost of one ticket is $28. \n\nLooking at the options, option B says 4t = 112; $28. That matches my calculation. Option A is also 4t = 112 but gives $448, which is way too high. Options C and D involve dividing by 4 on the left side, which is incorrect because you should divide both sides by 4 to solve for t. So, C and D are wrong. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If each ticket is $28, then four tickets would be 4 * 28. Let me compute that. 4 times 20 is 80, and 4 times 8 is 32, so 80 + 32 is 112. Yes, that adds up. So, the total cost is indeed $112 for four tickets. Therefore, the correct answer should be option B. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The equation is set up correctly, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I think option B is the right choice.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 4t = 112; $28**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Define the variable:** Let \\( t \\) represent the cost of one ticket.\n2. **Set up the equation:** The total cost for four tickets is $112, so \\( 4t = 112 \\).\n3. **Solve for \\( t \\):** Divide both sides by 4:  \n   \\( t = \\frac{112}{4} = 28 \\).\n4. **Verify:** \\( 4 \\times 28 = 112 \\), which matches the total cost given.\n\n**Answer:** B. 4t = 112; $28",
